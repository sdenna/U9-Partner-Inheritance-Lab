## TIPS FOR COLLABORATION 
When working collaboratively with another team member you **MUST** communicate to avoid merge conflicts.
When you are ready to combine your code, take the following steps:

- Person A: Commit and push code
- Person B: Fetch and pull code, then commit and push code
- Person A: Fetch and pull code

Now you BOTH have the completed code of each person
